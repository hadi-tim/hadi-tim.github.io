  Hi, my name is Hadi, a <b>Geophysicist</b>. I have 15 years experience in the Oil and Gas industry, covering planning and processing of numerous modern high fold 3D seismic surveys using state of the art processing tools and workflows for 
  controlled phase and controlled amplitude processing, signal and noise processing, velocities/statics, seismic attributes, and anisotropic time processing. In addition, multi-disciplinary collaboration in depth imaging and AVO/reservoir 
  analysis. I have Led and collaborated in multiple projects in UK Offshore, North Africa and Middle East, where I have processed and delivered various High Resolution 2D & 3D seismic surveys and addressing complex subsurface challenges.
</p>

__My skills at work are focused on:__
* **Advanced Land Seismic technology with High-Productivity & Broadband vibroseis methods_**: Distance Separated Simultaneous Sweeping / Slip-Sweeping (DS3/DS4); Independent Simultaneous Sweeping (ISS), and Blended seismic acquisition (Simultaneous Source).
* **Project Planning and Management:** Survey Design and Planning (OMNI 3D, iManage), Quality Control & Data Management backup (Omega).
* **Advanced Noise Attenuation techniques:** Using multi-scale methods such as Curvelet Transforms, Cadzow filtering. Near surface characterization using Surface Waves Analysis Modelling and Inversion (SWAMI).
* **Effective data-driven multiple suppression:** Using 3D GSMP (Generalized Surface Multiple Prediction) and Extended Interbed Multiple Prediction (XIMP), in combination with the Adaptive substruction algorithm.
Interpolation and regularization: 5D Matching Pursuit Fourier Interpolation (MPFI) algorithm to reconstruct the missing data in the frequency domain.

In addition, I am passionate about Python programming, Data Science and Machine Learning in the field of Geosciences. Recently, I gained good experience in programming and data analysis using Python. Contributing and challenging myself trough GitHub 
community by sharing Python codes on Data Analysis and Seismic Data Processing. Please check out my user profile on <a href="https://github.com/hadi-tim">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hadi-tim?tab=repositories">my portfolio
