  Hi, my name is Hadi, a <b>Geophysicist</b>. I have 15 years experience in the Oil and Gas industry, covering planning and processing of numerous modern high fold 3D seismic surveys using state of the art processing tools and workflows for 
  controlled phase and controlled amplitude processing, signal and noise processing, velocities/statics, seismic attributes, and anisotropic time processing. In addition, multi-disciplinary collaboration in depth imaging and AVO/reservoir 
  analysis. I have Led and collaborated in multiple projects in UK Offshore, North Africa and Middle East, where I have processed and delivered various High Resolution 2D & 3D seismic surveys and addressing complex subsurface challenges.
  I am passionate about Python programming, Data Science and Machine Learning in the field of Geosciences.Recently, I gained good experience in programming and analyzing data using Python. Contributing and challenging myself trough GitHub 
  community by sharing Python codes on Data Analysis and Seismic Data Processing. Please check out my user profile on <a href="https://github.com/hadi-tim">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hadi-tim?tab=repositories">my portfolio 
  website</a>.
