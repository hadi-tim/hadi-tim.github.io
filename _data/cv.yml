    - title: Project Leader Geophysicist
      institution: Schlumberger Digital & Integration, <b>Abu-Dhabi, UAE</b>
      year: Jul 2019 - Dec 2020
      description:
        
        - title: Solved and overcoming many challenges while processing the 2D/3D Land datasets.
          contents:
            - Worked on advanced processing workflows to build the shallow velocity model.
            - The presence of potential multiples generators (carbonite and dolomitic
              formations) exhibits the use of compulsive interbed de-multiple application such as (XIMP).
            - 5D Matching Pursuit Fourier Interpolation (MPFI) algorithm was used
              to reconstruct the missing data in the frequency domain
        - Reprocessed 7300km of modern and historical 2D seismic data (1980s) from different vintages and
          achieving significant uplift in the final stacked images when compared to the original processing.
        - Produced forecasts and project finance reports, interacted consistently with customers and prepare
          working meetings to make sure that the processing outcome truly meet the client requirements.

    - title: Geosolutions Geophysicist
      institution: Schlumberger Geosolutions, <b>Kuwait & Saudi Arabia</b>
      year: Aug 2012 - Jul 2019
      description:
        - Processed seismic data from raw field records through final migrated stack (Vibroseis/Dynamite).
        - Ensured all necessary testing is performed and results are presented clearly with improvement
          recommendations made where appropriate.
        - Wrote Shell scripts to streamline data entry and automate QC tasks and data management.
        - Developed and maintained strong client relationships though the communication of processing
          outcomes and attend meetings to discuss the processing goals.
        - Implemented and taught a training class for WG Junior Geophysicists and Client trainees on Omega
          Geophysical data processing platform technology and methodology.

    - title: Offshore Field Geophysicist
      institution: ION GX Technology, Scotland, <b>Offshore UK</b>.
      year: May 2012 - Aug 2012
      description: 
        - Real time data flow QC and fast track processing, including denoise and seismic interferences noise
          attenuation, brute stack QC.
        - Assisted with the deployment and recovery of in-sea gear from the vesselâ€™s back-deck as well as on
          small purpose work boat. Wrote reports and provide notes at crew change.


    - title: Geophysics Instructor
      institution: SONATRACH, Algerian Petroleum Institute, <b>Algeria</b>
      year: Feb 2010 - May 2010
      description:
        - Provided training classrooms on seismic acquisition principles for upstream oil & gas professionals.
        - Prepared workshops on basics of seismic data processing using ProMAX and Seismic Unix.


    - title: Field Geophysicist / Senior Field Geophysicist
      institution: Schlumberger WesternGeco, <b>Algeria</b>
      year: Nov 2005 - May 2012
      description:
        - Coordinated field crew start-ups tests and producing appropriate field parameters designs.
        - Planned 2D/3D seismic surveys, selected appropriate parameters and send pre-plan proposal to client.
        - Generated the seismic survey pre-plan and assigned the production plans to the field operations.
        - Conducted Quality control and analysis of the instrument tests, S/N ratio, Auxiliary checks and
          vibrators data verification in accordance with client specifications and procedures.
        - Performed field seismic data QC/data processing, confirmed source and receiver position and QC of
          shot records/field stacks to ensure about the data quality and compliance with contract specifications.
        - Prepared the Uphole/Refraction survey program and supervised the drilling and logging crew team.
        - Arranged the upgrade of the Geophysical computer system and maintained updates on Linux clusters
          and disk RAID storage.
